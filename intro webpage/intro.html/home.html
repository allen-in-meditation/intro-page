  <h2 class="header">About Allen</h2>
  <p class="center">Living in many different places has allowed me to explore many different paths in my life. Anything from exploring caves and playing with ferrets, to working in laboratories and art galleries, my interests have a wide range. Although, none of my explorations would have been possible with out the help and guidance of my peers, co-workers, teammate's and friends</p>
  <p class="center"> Because of the advice and guidance from a friend, I was introduced to web development and have fallen in love with it since then. Building content and being able to share it with the world was major draw into the filed. The ability to create and continuously learn is another reason why i love web-development</p>
